                The origins of quizzes can be traced back to ancient times, where 
                teachers and scholars used oral questions and written assessments 
                to evaluate students' understanding. Over time, quizzes evolved 
                alongside advancements in education and technology, taking various 
                forms such as multiple-choice tests, short answer questions, and 
                interactive online quizzes.

                Today, quizzes continue to play a crucial role in modern education 
                systems, helping educators gauge students' progress, identify areas 
                for improvement, and tailor instruction to meet individual learning 
                needs. With the advent of digital platforms and e-learning tools, 
                quizzes have become more accessible and customizable, offering 
                learners a dynamic and interactive learning experience.
